# Big-Brains: Mobile Memory Game

Welcome to **Big-Brains**, a mobile memory game designed to challenge and enhance your cognitive abilities. This project was developed as part of my academic curriculum as an Information Systems engineer.

## 🧠 **About the Project**
Big-Brains is an engaging and interactive memory game application built using **Java** and **Android Studio**. The app features an intuitive interface, captivating artwork, and three unique mini-games that test memory and concentration.

## 🎮 **Game Modes**
Big-Brains consists of three exciting game modes:

1. **Match the Pattern**
   - A sequence of patterns is displayed on the screen for a few seconds.
   - Players must replicate the pattern from memory.

2. **Match the Image**
   - Players are presented with 12 face-down images, where each image has an identical pair.
   - The goal is to match all the pairs by remembering the position of each image.

3. **Card Game (Find the Ace)**
   - Three cards are shuffled, and the player must identify and select the Ace card.

Each game mode tracks and stores player scores, encouraging players to improve their performance with every attempt.

## 🖌️ **Design and User Interface**
- **Simple, Intuitive, and Fun**: The user-friendly interface ensures players of all ages can enjoy the game.
- **Custom Artwork**: Unique and visually appealing designs make the experience more enjoyable.
- **Seamless Navigation**: The app offers smooth transitions between different game modes.

## 📊 **Score Tracking**
- Scores for each game mode are saved using an **SQLite database**.
- This feature enables players to monitor their progress and strive for higher scores.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: Core development language for the application logic.
- **Android Studio**: Integrated development environment (IDE) used for app design, development, and testing.
- **SQLite**: Local database for storing player scores and game data.
